# Housing-Prices-Regression
---
This project aims to create and compare model that could be used to predict housing prices based on certain predictor variables, such as the number of bathrooms, bedrooms, and many others. It should be noted that whilst the data is sourced from kaggle, it is downloaded and placed in github, thus, making it easier to access

**Data source**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/denkuznetz/housing-prices-regression/data

Some of the algorithms that would be used are as follows:
1. Simple Linear Regression
2. Polynomial Regression
3. Gradient Boosting Regressor

**Note: The environment used to create this project is Google Colab, and as such, it would work best on said environment**
